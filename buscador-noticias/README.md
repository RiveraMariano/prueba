# News Search Engine

Website link [News Search Engine](https://buscador-noticias-mrivera.netlify.app/).

## Summary

This is project 7/10, this project has a select where the category of news to be searched is chosen and when the button is pressed they are shown in small letters that have a button to redirect to the page where the official report is. (Unfortunately this api became a paid api and cannot be consulted in a project in production, however, if the project is installed and run locally, the news is shown). 

### Learning 

In the development of this project, I learned: 
- To use an api that asks for one parameter => [API](https://newsapi.org/).
- To use .module files to add styles to components.

### Run Locally

- Clone the repository `https://github.com/RiveraMariano/react-projects.git`.
- The project is on the `buscador-noticias` folder.
- Open the cmd and get the project route.
- Run `npm install` for the dependencies.
- Run `npm start` (The project should run in the default browser).
