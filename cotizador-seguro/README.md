## Summary

This is my third web application developed with react. I decided to start learning the javascript library because in the future when I finish my degree I would like to specialize in web development. This website uses the useState and useEffect hooks in addition to local storage to manage medical appointments, and for the hosting of the application I used the Netlify platform.

### Functionality

The application uses the hooks useState and useEffect, the first one is in charge of modifying the states of the objects where the information of the appointment is stored. The second is responsible for showing the expense.

### Design

I used the skeleton style library in conjunction with google fonts for website text. The other styles are inside a style sheet that is imported into the HTML. It is a simple design of a form and some cards to show the appointments. I used spinkit for the square animation and react-transition-group for an extra animation. And Emotion for the styled components instead of using a css file.

### Run Locally

- Clone the repository `https://github.com/RiveraMariano/react-projects.git`
- The project is on the `control-presupuesto` folder
- Open the cmd and get the project route
- Run `npm start`
- The project should run in the default browser :)
