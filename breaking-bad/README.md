# Breaking Bad

Website link [Breaking Bad](https://breaking-bad-mrivera.netlify.app/).

## Summary  

This is the fourth web application I developed with react. I decided to start learning the javascript library because in the future when I finish my degree I would like to specialize in web development. This website uses the useState and useEffect hooks in addition to local storage to manage medical appointments, and for the hosting of the application I used the Netlify platform.

### Functionality

I implemented an API to get quotes from the series Breaking Bad. The application uses the hooks useState and useEffect, the first one is in charge of modifying the states of the objects where the information of the appointment is stored. The second is responsible for creating the expense and decrease the remainder of the budget.

### Design

I installed Emotion library to create styled components and a normal css file for the body of the app.

### Run Locally

- Clone the repository `https://github.com/RiveraMariano/react-projects.git`
- The project is on the `breaking-bad` folder
- Open the cmd and get the project route
- Run `npm start`
- The project should run in the default browser :)
