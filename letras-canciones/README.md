# Song's Lyrics

Website link [Song's Lyrics](https://letras-canciones-mrivera.netlify.app/).

## Summary

This is project 9/10, this project has 2 inputs, the first to enter the name of an artist and the other for the name of a song, when the search button is pressed, all the lyrics of the consulted song are returned. (This project consisted of 2 api's, however, since both could not have the information of an artist or a specific song, I leave out the second api that was responsible for returning the artist information). 

### Learning 

In the development of this project, I learned: 
- To consult 2 api's at the same time.
- First API => [API](https://lyricsovh.docs.apiary.io/#).
- Second API => [API](https://www.theaudiodb.com/).
